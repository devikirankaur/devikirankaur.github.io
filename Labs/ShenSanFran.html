        <h1> San Francisco: the best and the worst </h1>
        
        <h2> The <em> best </em> neighborhood is the <strong> Mission </strong> </h2>
        
        <p> I love the Mission because it is the home of some of my favorite metaphysical schools: Psychic Horizons and Asta Yoga. </p>
        
        <h2> The <em> worst </em> neighborhood is the <strong> Tenderloin </strong> </h2>
        
        <p> I do not love the Tenderloin because it smells and it is filled with empty transmediums. </p>
